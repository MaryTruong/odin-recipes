    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Get about six to seven pounds of beef bones, add them to your stock pot,
        add filtered water to cover (about 6-7 quarts) and bring the water to a
        boil. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface and reduce the heat to
        a gentle, slow simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the onion or shallots in half. Slice unpeeled ginger in half
        lengthwise. Char ginger and onion on a grill, gas stovetop or by
        broiling in the oven. Watch closely, turn on occasion and remove from
        the oven after about 10-15 minutes. Once charred, remove from the heat
        for a few minutes to let them cool. Remove the outer skin from the
        onion/shallots and peel the ginger. Remove any blackened pieces and add
        them to the beef broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add dried shrimp, cinnamon, star anise, fennel seeds and cardamom pods.
        Cover and keep the broth gently simmering for four to six hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take one fuji apple and peel and core it. Slice it up into chunks and
        add it to the broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain the broth and if using right away, season with 2 TBSPs fish
        sauce. Add up to 2 TBSPs more, to taste. If not using right away, cool
        and store the broth in the fridge and season with fish sauce upon
        reheating.
      </li>
      <li>Thinly slice the raw beef and set aside.</li>
      <li>Prepare rice noodles according to package directions.</li>
      <li>
        Prepare the garnishes and seasonings. Chop herbs coarsely or simple
        place whole leaves in bowls for individual garnishes. Place fish sauce
        and/or garlic vinegar in small condiment bowls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place rice noodles in individual bowls, place raw beef (or other types
        of beef) on top and ladle over with hot broth. Add herbs and seasonings,
        to taste.
      </li>
